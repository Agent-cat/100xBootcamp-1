You are given the coordinates of a point (X,Y)

on a Cartesian plane. Your task is to determine the location of the point.

The possible locations are:

    Origin — if X=0

and Y=0
X axis — if Y=0
and X≠0
Y axis — if X=0
and Y≠0
1st Quadrant — if X>0
and Y>0
2nd Quadrant — if X<0
and Y>0
3rd Quadrant — if X<0
and Y<0
4th Quadrant — if X>0
and Y<0

Input

A single line containing two integers X
and Y (−109≤X,Y≤109)

.
Output

Print a single line indicating the location of the point.
